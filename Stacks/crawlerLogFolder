The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.

The operations are described below:

"../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
"./" : Remain in the same folder.
"x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String[] logs) {
        int len = logs.length;
        int counter = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
            System.out.println(logs[i]);
            if(logs[i].equals("./")){
                // System.out.println("Inside same Folder.");
            }
            else if(logs[i].equals("../")){
                // System.out.println("Moving to parent Folder.");
                counter--;
                if(counter < 0) counter = 0;
            }
            else{
                // System.out.println("Moving to sub Folder.");
               counter++; 
            }
        }
        return counter;
        // return Math.abs(counter);
    }
}
